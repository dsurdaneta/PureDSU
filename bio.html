Meet Dan, he is the DSU Developer main character that lives in an 8bit world with his turtle pet Oz.
His main Quest is to create simple and functional applications, helping others finding what they need. He fights bugs and is equipped with a Bass guitar as his weapon and a laptop as shield. 
As most programmers he drinks coffee and transform it into code. As most of the 8bit characters he uses coins to get the higher scores.
He likes to hear music to power up his works and to read about programming languages to level up his coding skills. If you need help in your personal Quest don’t hesitate, and contact him, probably he’s interested on the adventures you could provide.
